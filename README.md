# PISM test website

This repository contains the source code for the new PISM website.

The Jekyll theme was originally forked from the [Bulma Clean Theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme) created by C.S. Rhymes. For instructions how to customize the theme, see [README.orig.md](README.orig.md).

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is set up just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).
